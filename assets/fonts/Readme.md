msgothic_0 is used for Japanese only and is based off of MS Gothic

msgothic_2 is used for English and is based off of PT Sans

If you're developing a translation into a non-English language like Vietnamese and you find that the font is missing characters needed for your language, try renaming the two `msgothic_2 for non-English` files over the PT Sans ones.  These are based off of Deja-Vu Sans which has support for more languages than PT Sans does.
